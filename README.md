<h2>A long time ago, in a repository far, far away...</h2>

<h4><b>Episode IV</b></h4>

<h1><b>A NEW DEVELOPER</b></h1>

<br>

<i>It is a period of great technological upheaval.<br>
A young developer emerges from the depths of code<br>
repositories, wielding the ancient arts of programming<br>
and the mysterious ways of the Force.</i>

<br><br>

<i>The <b>GALACTIC FEDERATION OF DEVELOPERS</b><br>
has been scattered across the digital cosmos,<br>
each warrior-coder fighting to bring balance<br>
to the chaos of legacy systems and forgotten<br>
documentation.</i>

<br><br>

<i>Among them stands <b>MANAS</b>, a padawan<br>
developer whose destiny is intertwined<br>
with the fate of countless applications<br>
yet to be born...</i>
